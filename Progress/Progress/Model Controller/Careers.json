If you aren’t 100% sure what this looks like, that’s ok! The point is to start thinking about what qualities you may want in a job later on.",

If you are already actively doing the above (to the point where having additional goals would not be helpful, then you may set goals for different aspects of your search, but they should focus on the most important elements of creating a strong professional brand via your professional connections, artifacts (portfolio, resume, github, etc.), and research/knowledgeability about your field.

Job Search Strategy: Create a Huntr account if you don’t have one already (https://app.huntr.co/lambda-school/signup) and add at least 5 companies you’re interested in. Bonus if you know people who work at these companies already! For these companies, search their job postings to find any jobs that you are interested in. Go through the job descriptions and map out what qualifications you meet, what qualifications you don’t fully meet, and list out key stories/examples to back up your experience in these areas. Want additional practice? Update your resume and a cover letter so they are specifically tailored to each of these roles (you should have a different resume/cover letter for each role, unless two really are almost identical in their description!) Submit a written summary (and your resume/cover letter edits, if you do them) to your PM with your weekly sprint retro.",
